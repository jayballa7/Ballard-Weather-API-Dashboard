## General info
My goal with this project was to create a weather dashboard by using the OpenWeather API. 

## Technologies
* Visual Studio Code
* Github
* Git Bash
* Bootstrap
* Jquery
* Ajax
* OpenWeather API

## Features
List of features ready:
* User can search for a city. The page will automatically populate with the city's current weather and 5 day forecast.
* The cities the user searched for will be stored in local storage and displayed in the left column.
* When the page is refreshed, the weather for the last city the user searched for populates.
* The current weather displays the city, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV Index. 
* The 5 day forecast displays the day, weather icon, temperature and humidity.
* HTML and CSS dynamically created using Jquery.
* Responsive design using Bootstrap and media queries.

## Status
* Page can use further styling to accomodate different screens. 
* Issue with using API to get the UV Index (sometimes there is an error saying the value is undefined, therefore the current weather does not populate).

## Inspiration
A credit to my tutor for helping me figure out how to implement local storage and modularize my code.
